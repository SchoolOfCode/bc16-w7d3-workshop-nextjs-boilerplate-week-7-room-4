# Objectives

- A "founders" page that works on mobile (don't worry about desktop for now)
- A menu that works as expected and looks how it should on mobile. This means you can click the menu button, the full screen menu appears, you can click the close button in that menu to close it.
- The menu will have links in it so I can move between the Home Page and Founders page.
